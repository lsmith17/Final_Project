							Square Roots:

We have to understand the definition of a square root to understand how to find them:

A square root is a number that equals another number when multiplied by itself.

For example:

2 x 2 = 4.  So, the square root of 4 = 2.
3 x 3 = 9.  So, the square root of 9 = 3.
4 x 4 = 16. So, the square root of 16 = 4.

2, 4, and 16 are all examples of perfect squares, because the square of 2x2 = 4, 3x3 = 9 and 4x4 = 16.

Your teacher may have made you memorize some of these numbers and their squares. If not, you will need to find all numbers that divide into the number evenly.

A square number will always be a composite number; a number that can be divided up evenly.

Ex: Find the square root of 36.

Other than just memorizing, we can find the square root of 36 by finding all of the factor pairs!

1. 1x36
2. 2x18
3. 3x12
4. 4x9
5. 6x6

Notice that #5 is 6x6 which takes 6 and mutliplies it by itself to get 36. That is what we are looking for!

This means that the square root of 36 is 6!
