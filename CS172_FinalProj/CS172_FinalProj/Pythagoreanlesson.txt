In a right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

So: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For the example above:

A = 3
B = 4
C = ?

We do not know c, so we will have to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find out what it is!

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can see that the square of A, and the square of B, will equal the square of C.

So:
square of A = 3*3 = 9
square of B = 4*4 = 16

square of A + square of B = Square of C = 25

Now we take the square root of the Square of C to find C! Simple!:

sqrt(25) = 5

The hypotenuse is 5!
